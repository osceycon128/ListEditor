# List Editor
hello! welcome to my first public Python project. this project is very low-level, but i hope to make better things in the future!

this program will allow you to edit list variables (a type of variable in Python) and save/import them to the script's directory! it also comes packaged as a .exe file, so you don't have to run it from the terminal to pick a directory.
the original .py file is included as the other file in the releases.
BY THE WAY if you use the original python file you can run this on linux.


# Why?
well, because, this was just a little project to get me into Python. the only reason i'm publishing it is to show the world my first steps in programming.

# Can I modify and publish this somewhere else?
yes, you can, aslong as you contact me via email (oscarcon42@gmail.com) first. i just like to know when someones making something on my project.

# How do I use it?
it's as simple as downloading "main-executable.zip", then running the .exe file inside! the command line should give you details on what you can do and how you can do it.
once again, any questions, comments, or concerns can go directly to my email at oscarcon42@gmail.com.

enjoy!
